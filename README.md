dotfiles
========

A few of my dotfiles.

Xresources

The Xresources file adds the IR\_Black color scheme to urxvt.

i3

The i3 config is for the i3 window manager

emacs{,.d}

Emacs configs

irbic
-----

Some configs to make irb more usable

screenrc
--------

In case I don't want to use tmux for some reason I have a screenrc

tmux.conf
---------

Config for tmux.  Makes it look much nicer (and behave a bit more like screen)
