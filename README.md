A few of my dotfiles.  Vim dotfiles can be found in https://github.com/ssgelm/vim_dotfiles

The Xresources file adds the IR\_Black color scheme to urxvt.

The i3 config is for the i3 window manager

emacs{,.d}

Emacs configs

irbic

Some configs to make irb more usable

screenrc

In case I don't want to use tmux for some reason I have a screenrc

tmux.conf

Config for tmux.  Makes it look much nicer (and behave a bit more like screen)
